Per our group discussion, here are the things you should expect from yourself and from your classmates:


- **Honesty**: Be truthful in general of course, but also specifically when lessons/topics are tough. Other people might have the same questions, so don't just pretend to understand everything.


- **Communication**: Everyone has a unique perspective to offer, and we can learn a lot from each other, but only if we communicate well.


- **Collaboration**: There's no single right answer to any programming problem. Many different approaches will work, so bounce ideas off each other and discuss the pros and cons of different approaches.


- **Patience**:
  - We are a diverse group with varying levels of prior experience with programming. Remember, someone who needs extra help in week 1 might really excel later and be able to offer help. Be respectful and work as a team.
  - Just like in the professional world, we're not all using the same setup (operating systems, tools, etc.) so be flexible when someone runs into technical problems you didn't have.


- **Persistence**: *Everyone* in this class can be successful if they put in enough time and effort. Don't let yourself give up, even when assignments are tough, and encourage each other!


- **Challenge Each Other**:
  - Some *friendly* competition can help encourage achievement. Be creative and encourage each other to go above an beyond the requirements for each assignment.
  - When helping a classmate, don't always give them the answer right away. Try to point them in the right direction and let them have that "ah ha" moment when the figure it out for themselves.


- **When You're Stuck**:
  1. Try to figure it out yourself. Use Google, StackOverflow, tutorials, lesson notes, etc.
  2. If you still need help, work with classmates. Two (or more) heads are better than one!
  3. If you still need help, ask Drew and/or Charlie, but be ready to explain the work you already did to solve the issue.


- **Be On Time**: Treat this like a job. Be professional and responsible.


- **Participate**: Focus on the present! If you're working on a lab from yesterday or browsing Facebook during a lesson, you won't be able to absorb new material, and your classmates won't benefit from your perspective, or the good questions you might ask.
