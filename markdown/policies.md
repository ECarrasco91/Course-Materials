# Academic Policies

This is a summary of key policies. Please refer to the [GA Course Catalog](https://ga-core.s3.amazonaws.com/cms/files/files/000/004/365/original/GA_Catalog-NYC_v1v6_20160910_bvm.pdf#page=19) for full details.


**Graduation Requirements:** In order to graduate and receive Outcomes support, students must:
- Receive a passing grade on ALL projects
- Complete at least 80% of assignments (i.e. labs and homeworks)
- Accrue no more than 3 unexcused absences, per the attendance policy below


**Attendance**
  - Absenses may be excused in cases of illness, medical emergencies, death in the family, religious observances, etc. on a case by base basis. Students must notify Charlie and/or Drew via Slack or email of absences as soon as is reasonably possible.
  - Every 3 late arrivals and/or early departures count as 1 unexcused absence. Students must notify Charlie and/or Drew ASAP if they will be late, or need to leave early.
  - On days when students are allowed to work outside the classroom, in other parts of the GA campus, students MUST be present in room 3E when attendance is taken, or physically check in with Charlie/Drew prior to attendance being taken. Otherwise, we will not search the campus for you, we will mark you absent.


**Assignment and Project Submissions**
- All assignments and projects must be submitted via GitHub pull request.
- All assignments are due by 9:00 am the next class day after they are assigned.
- Assignments handed in late will NOT be counted toward the 80% completion requirement.
- Students will present all projects to their classmates and must submit projects before presentations begin. Project due dates and presentation times will be made clear when projects are assigned. 
- Projects not receving a passing grade or submitted late will not count, and will disqualify students from graduating and receiving Outcomes support.
- Assignments and projects that contain errors which prevent the code from building and compiling will not be counted. Assignments and projects that build, but immediately crash when run will not be counted. You must always ensure your code builds and runs successfully!
